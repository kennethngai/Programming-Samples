This is my final project of my Software Method Class. This was the fourth computer science out of the five all computer science majors have to take.\

For this project: I worked with a classmate to create a library checkout system. 
The library contained user generated books as well as took information from the New York Times Best Seller's API . 
The program was able to allow users to create their own array list for books they have checked out. 
Users were allowed to see the information of the books by inputting a book's call number or title. 
The system also allowed users to return books they have checked out.
